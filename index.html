                of the printing and typesetting
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever
                since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
                took a galley of type and scrambled it
                to make a type specimen book. It has
                survived not only five centuries, but
                also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                popularised in the 1960s with the release
                of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                passages, and more recently with desktop
                publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
